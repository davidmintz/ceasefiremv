    <h2 class="text-center">actions and events</h2>
    <p>Protest alone is not sufficient, but it is necessary in order to promote public awareness and support
    for a permanent ceasefire, an end to US military aid to Israel, and to challenge the climate of neo-McCarthyist
        repression that falsely equates opposition to Israel's
        genocidal war on Gaza with antisemitism.</p>
    <h3 id="standout" class="p-3 my-4 rounded-3 text-center border border-success border-4" style="font-size:larger; background-color: red;color:white;"><strong>Permanent ceasefire!
            End the occupation!</strong></h3>
    <p>CeasefireMV holds standouts in solidarity with the Palestinian cause at the Five Corners intersection in Vineyard Haven every Sunday, rain or shine. Come join us!
        Our next standout at Five Corners will be <strong>{{ standout.nextStandoutDate }}</strong>.</p>
    <img src="{{ asset('images/17-dec.5-corners.jpg') }}" alt="CeasefireMV members standing on the sidewalk holding signs demanding a ceasefire" class="img-fluid mb-3">
    <p>We've been out there every Sunday since November 19, 2023. Anyone who shares our goals -- stop the genocide in Gaza, fight the big lie that equates criticism of Zionism with antisemitism --
    is welcome to join us in this weekly demonstration. We stay for {{ standout.duration_informal }}, but you can arrive late or leave early if need be. If you
    don't bring a sign, you can borrow one from our supply. If you aren't comfortable standing, you can bring a chair or use one of ours.
    </p>
