            <p><strong>MV For Palestine</strong>, also known as <strong>Ceasefire MV</strong>, is a group of people living
                on Martha's Vineyard (Massachusetts, USA) who demand an immediate, permanent ceasefire and halt to the Israeli
                state's genocidal war on Gaza.  We welcome all those who share our objectives: stop the genocide,
                and fight the lie that conflates criticism of the Israeli state with antisemitism.</p>
