            <p><strong>CeasefireMV</strong>, also known as <strong>MV For Palestine</strong>, is a group of people living
                on Martha's Vineyard (Massachusetts, USA) who demand an immediate, permanent ceasefire and halt to the Israeli
                state's genocidal war on Gaza.  We welcome all those who share our objectives: stop the genocide,
                and fight the lie that conflates criticism of the Israeli state with antisemitism.</p>

                        to protest the persecution, harassment and blatantly illegal detention of university students
                        and staff who have been targeted by the Trump administration for speaking out against genocide.
