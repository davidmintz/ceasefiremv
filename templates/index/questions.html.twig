    <p>Here are our responses to a few of the comments and questions that have been addressed to us, most of them by passersby
    at our weekly stand-outs in Vineyard Haven where we protest the Israeli genocidal aggression against Gaza, the West Bank and
        Lebanon.</p>

    <p><strong>You support Hamas. You support terrorism, rape and mutilation.</strong></p>
    <p>The notion that support for a ceasefire and opposition to genocide imply endorsement of whatever happened on October 7 is
        patently absurd.</p>
    <p><strong>What about the 1200 Israeli victims of October 7?</strong></p>
    <p>The slaughter of countless tens of thousand of innocent Palestinians will do nothing to bring them back. But our position in
        regard to Hamas' October 7 attack warrants <a href="/october7">its own entire page</a>.
<p><strong>What about the hostages? Where is your sign demanding their release?</strong></p>
    <p>We fervently wish for a deal to exchange hostages for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. A necessary condition to bring
    that about is a ceasefire. Concern for the fate of the hostages militates in favor of a ceasefire, not against it.</p>
    <p><strong>Where is your Israeli flag? There is another side to the story. Your position is not balanced.</strong></p>
        <p>Anyone who studies
        the history of Palestine/Israel learns that the establishment of Israel in 1948 was based on ethnic cleansing
            of the indigenous Palestinian population. Over 700,000 native Palestinians were driven from their homeland and never
            permitted to return. Their land was stolen, their villages demolished (see, for example, Pappé, Ilan. <strong><a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Ethnic-Cleansing-of-Palestine/Ilan-Pappe/9781851685554" target="_blank">The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine</a></strong>. Oxford: Oneworld Publications, 2006).
            They have ever since been subjected to apartheid conditions, continuous oppression and violation of their human
            rights under Israeli occupation. Armed resistance and occasional acts of violent retaliation should come as no surprise.
    <p>We don't wave the Israeli flag because the policies and conduct of the Israeli state are those of a bloodthirsty,
    rogue terror state with no regard for international law or human rights.</p>
    <p>Our position is not "balanced" because the objective reality is anything but balanced. One would not demand
    a "balanced" treatment of the African slave trade or the Holocaust.</p>
<p><strong>My Polish grandfather was an avid Zionist who emigrated to Israel in the 1930s. The rest of his family remained in Poland and
        was exterminated by the Nazis. Were it not for Israel, I would not be here today. Only in Israel can Jews be safe.
    </strong></p>
    <p>It is true that the Zionist movement emerged in the 1880s in response to genuine antisemitism. Jewish immigration from Europe into Palestine
    increased dramatically in the 1930s with the rise of Nazism. None of that excuses the campaign of ethnic cleansing carried out by Zionist militias in 1947-1948,
        nor the brutal military occupation, apartheid system, land theft, bombing and massacres carried out by Israel ever since. The conduct of the Israeli
        government, particularly the war of extermination unleashed following October 7, 2023, is indeed reminiscent of Nazism. It is a horrible irony that Zionist
        descendants of Holocaust victims are carrying out Nazi-like atrocities. This phenomenon, where a group that is persecuted pays
        it forward by doing it to another, is known in psychology as <em>ìdentification with the aggressor</em>.
   <p> As for whether Israel is the only safe place for Jews, this is highly debatable. The relentless persecution, oppression and
    dispossession of Palestinians by Israelis undermines rather than enhances Israeli security over the long term.</p>

     <p><strong>Israel has a right to exist, and a right to defend itself.</strong></p>
    <p>To paraphrase the historian Avi Shlaim:  the establishment of Israel in 1948 involved a monumental injustice against indigenous
    Palestinians, and that injustice has only been exacerbated over time. It has reached its cruel climax with Israel's genocidal rampage
    in Gaza, which has now expanded to the West Bank and Lebanon. As the veteran US diplomat Chas Freeman has observed, for much of world opinion
        the question is no longer whether Israel has a right to exist; it self-evidently does exist. Rather, the question is whether Israel
    <em>deserves</em> to exist. Given its horrendous criminal behavior, it is by no means a foregone conclusion that it does. A reasonable solution,
        albeit not easily achieved, would be the peaceful dismantlement of the Israeli state and the establishment of a single, secular,
        de-Zionized, democratic state with full social and political equality for all its inhabitants.</p>
    <p>As for the right to often-invoked self-defense, that might be a tenable argument if we were talking about self-defense.
        But international law does not recognize any right to self-defense in illegally occupied territories, and there
    is nothing defensive about the countless atrocities being committed by Israel:  collective punishment of millions of civilians;
        the use of starvation as a weapon; the deliberate and systematic destruction of infrastructure; the bombing of schools and hospitals;
        incineration of defenseless refugees in tents; the deliberate targeting of journalists and aid workers.</p>

    <p><strong>Why aren't you talking about horrors taking place in the Sudan or Ukraine? You single out Israel, therefore you are antisemitic.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Hamas' 1988 charter calls for the murder of Jews. They are terrorists and must be eliminated.</strong></p>

    <p>We disagree.</p>
