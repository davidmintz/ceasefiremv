    <p>Here are our responses to a few of the comments and questions that have been addressed to us, most of them by motorists
    passing by as we stand out in Vineyard Haven to protest the Israeli genocide against Gaza</p>

    <p><strong>You support Hamas. You support terrorists, rape and mutilation.</strong></p>
    <p>The notion that support for a ceasefire and opposition to genocide imply endorsement of whatever happened on October 7 is
        patently absurd.</p>
    <p><strong>What about the 1200 Israeli victims of October 7?</strong></p>
    <p>The slaughter of tens of thousand of innocent Palestinians will do nothing to bring them back.</p>
<p><strong>What about the hostages? Where is your sign demanding their release?</strong></p>
    <p>We fervently wish for a deal to exchange hostages for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. A necessary condition to bring
    that about is a ceasefire. Concern for the fate of the hostages militates in favor of a ceasefire, not against it.</p>
    <p><strong>Where is your Israeli flag? There is another side to the story. Your position is not balanced.</strong></p>
        <p>If you study
        the history of Palestine/Israel, you soon learn that the establishment of Israel in 1948 was based on ethnic cleansing
            of the indigenous Palestinian population. Over 700,000 native Palestinians were driven from their homeland and never
            permitted to return. Their land was stolen. They have ever since been subjected to apartheid conditions,
            continuous oppression and violation of their human rights under Israeli occupation. Armed resistance and occasional
    acts of violent retaliation should come as no surprise.
    <p>We don't wave the Israeli flag because the policies and conduct of the Israeli state are appalling.</p>
    <p>Our position is not "balanced" because the objective reality is anything but balanced. One would not demand
    a "balanced" treatment of the African slave trade or the Holocaust.</p>
<p><strong>My Polish grandfather was an avid Zionist who emigrated to Israel in the 1930s. The rest of his family remained in Poland and
        was exterminated by the Nazis. Were it not for Israel, I would not be here today. Only in Israel can Jews be safe.

    <p><strong>Israel has a right to exist, and a right to defend itself.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>What about the horrors in the Sudan or Ukraine? Why aren't you talking about that?</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Because you demand a ceasefire, you are antisemitic.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Hamas' 1988 charter calls for the murder of Jews. They are terrorists and must be eliminated.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>You are idiots.</strong></p>
    <p>We disagree.</p>
